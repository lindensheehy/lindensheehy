# Linden Sheehy

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Linden, a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa with a deep passion for low-level programming, game engines, and reverse engineering. Coding isn't just a career goal â€” it's what I genuinely love doing. Iâ€™m always building personal projects to push my understanding of how things work under the hood.

Iâ€™m looking for opportunities in **game engine development**, **embedded systems**, **reverse engineering**, or any role that works close to the system and lets me keep learning!

## Featured Projects

### [Kiwi3D](https://github.com/lindensheehy/Kiwi3D)

- A fully custom-built 3D scene editor and software renderer showcasing my low-level graphics and systems programming skills.
- Developed entirely from scratch over two years in C++, relying solely on `windows.h`.
- Features range from a custom math library to a software renderer and a custom UI system â€” all built without relying on any third-party libraries.

Originally a passion project, Kiwi3D grew into a 17k LOC codebase, and I've worked hard to give it a professional-level polish. If youâ€™re interested in game engines, 3D graphics, or just curious how it works, definitely check it out! ðŸš€

### [Rust ESP Overlay](https://github.com/lindensheehy/RustOverlay)

- A deep dive into reverse engineering and Windows internals.
- Hooks into Rustâ€™s game memory via assembly injection and the Win32 API to render a real-time overlay tracking entities on private servers.
- Sharpened my skills in analyzing black-box code, low-level debugging, and rendering techniques.

While ethically nuanced, this project was built strictly for educational purposes, and it showcases my reverse engineering skills. (See [the README](https://github.com/lindensheehy/RustOverlay/blob/main/README.md) for details on ethical and legal considerations!)

## Background

Alongside my coursework, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through projects and internships. Iâ€™ve also worked two co-op positions as a Student Data Analyst (check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linden-sheehy-a7282b299/) for more details). Whether working solo or on a team, I love applying critical thinking and resourcefulness to solve challenging problems.
