# Linden Sheehy

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Linden, a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa with a deep passion for low-level programming, game engines, and reverse engineering. Iâ€™m working to build a career in coding, but itâ€™s also just what I love. Iâ€™m always diving into personal projects to push my understanding of how things work under the hood.

## Featured Projects

**Kiwi3D** â€” A 3D scene editor and software renderer I built completely from scratch in C++ using only `windows.h`. Over two years, I designed everything myselfâ€”from a custom math library all the way up to a software renderer and custom UI systemâ€”all without third-party libraries. This was honestly just a passion project that evolved into a 17k LOC codebase, but Iâ€™ve worked hard to give it a professional-level polish. If you have any interest in game engines, 3D graphics, or just low-level code in general, definitely go [check it out](https://github.com/lindensheehy/Kiwi3D)! ðŸš€

**Rust ESP Overlay** â€” A technical deep dive into reverse engineering and Windows internals. This project hooks into Rustâ€™s game memory and uses assembly injection plus the Win32 API to render a real-time overlay tracking entities on private servers. It sharpened my abilities in understanding black-box code, assembly coding, and rendering. (See [the README](https://github.com/lindensheehy/RustOverlay) for any ethical or legal concerns!)

## Background

Iâ€™m currently studying Software Engineering at the University of Ottawa, and alongside my coursework, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through projects and internships. Iâ€™ve also worked two co-op positions as a Student Data Analyst (check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linden-sheehy-a7282b299/) for more details). Whether working solo or on a team, I love applying critical thinking and resourcefulness to solve challenging problems.
